actual notes from the videos
---------------------------
django-admin startproject budget_project
creates new project

main directory -> manage.py and lower directory w/ same name

in main directory -> python manage.py startapp budget 
creates budget app in that directory w/ all its shit and a SQLite db

views.py
from Django.http import HttpResponse

create home method with request arg. Will return a render type thing

in app directory (NOT project directory), create urls.py and copy from project urls.py
import views into urls.py. 
this means that you want to have a list of path() guys with the first arg beign the path and hte second being the method that handles it. third arg is name='budget-home' or something unique

project urls
import Django urls include too
add another path() object with first beign like 'budget/' and the second being include('budget.urls')
to connect shit here


Templates
in budget app directory -> create templates directory
in tempaltes create budget directory
in that create .html files

in budget app, look for apps.py. should have a BudgetConfig type class
Add thjat to project settings.py  INSTALLED_APPS 'budget.apps.BudgetConfig' type shit

in views.py, change return to use render({{path to template file budget/home.html}}
